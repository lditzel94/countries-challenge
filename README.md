### Develop a RESTful API

A RESTful API should be developed that allows us to manage country property information (identifier â€“ automatically
generated, name, capital, region, subregion, area).

1. It should be possible to create a new country from the created API with all its properties;
2. It should be possible to list all previously created countries;
3. It must be possible to modify the data of a previously created country;
4. It must be possible to delete a previously created country;
5. It should be possible to sort the list of countries by any of their properties.

The API will be developed in Java and the database to store country information will be relational.
